E1101:Module 'pygame' has no 'init' member
solution:
Those messages are generated by pylint. Pylint disables loading C extensions (Pygame in this case) by default for security reasons. To enable it add this to your settings:

"python.linting.pylintArgs": [
    "--extension-pkg-whitelist=pygame"
]
If you have other settings right, this should be enough.
